                        Analysis and a Postdoc in Artificial Intelligence applied to Remote Sensing. With over 11 years
                        of
                        combined academic and industrial experience, I have contributed to national and European-funded
                        research projects as well as delivered AI-driven business solutions. My expertise lies in
                        applying
                        AI to Earth Observation (EO) and cloud computing, bridging research innovation with practical,
                        real-world applications. I have also shared my knowledge through training sessions and
                        workshops.
                        Passionate about tackling complex challenges with AI, I am always eager to learn and embrace new
                        opportunities.</p>
